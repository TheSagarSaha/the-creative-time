# The Creative Time
### Time management made easy

<hr />

This is a creative app which uses React and Node.js that helps to schedule tasks and set todo lists easily. The scheduler will automatically set the tasks according to the top priority and with a 15 minute grace period within the tasks. Similarly, the todo lists will contain tags like `important`, `urgent`, `school`, `work`, and many more.

### How to run the app?
<hr/>

Since this web-app requires node, it cannot be published through the github pages. In order to run the app, you will need to execute the following lines of code in your terminal.

First you will need to make a clone of the current repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/TheSagarSaha/the-creative-time.git ```

Then change the directory and go inside source directory:

``` cd the-creative-time ```

After you have changed the directory, you will need to download and install the node dependencies to run the web-app. Some of the dependencies include React, React-DOM, and many more. Execute the following line of code to install them. **Note: Make sure you have node installed within your local machine. To check whether you have node running on your computer, you can check the version of your node by running `node --version`. If you do not get an error, you are good to go. But if you encounter an error, please make sure you have installed node correctly.**

``` npm install```

Please wait until all the dependencies are installed. This will take quiet some time since React is a very large module. After you have installed all the dependencies, run the following code:

```npm start```

The web-app will shortly run and your default web browser will open up. Alternatively, you can also go to your web browser and go to the following URL: `localhost:3000`.
